## Low Cost Seismic Survey System
One of the biggest problems encountered in geophysical surveys is the correct selection of the first arrival times of seismic waves and then the creation of the best linear digression for the creation of the curves, whose slopes provide us with useful information about seismic wave propagation velocities, (Boore, 2006) (Grandjean, 2005). Current publication presents an automatic way of selecting the best travel time curves which minimizes the analysis time of the experimental data. The thickness of each layer is automatically calculated in accordance with the theory of seismic refracted rays and also the application provides the possibility of quickly estimating the geological composition of the subsoil for relatively shallow depths. (Sawasdee Yordkayhun C. J., 2007) (Hans D. Ackermann, 1986) (Whiteley, 2004) (Philip Kearey, 2013). Reference is also made to this applications extension in respect of early warning of a potential upcoming landslide when water saturation exceeds a specific threshold.
